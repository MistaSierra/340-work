1. Here's what I have so far. This is one of the most difficult assignments in this class so far. I'm having trouble linking my style and index so I'm not even sure if any of my style code works.
2. I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of information needed for one assignment. I know I can get this if I had a little more experience or practice but right now, its a no go.
3. My goal for this assignment was for it too feel a bit storybook'ish, but was stumped half'ish way through so I didn't get super close. I also wanted to make it a lot more readable, since the website it took it from basically had it in one big block of unreadable text, which made it hard to follow. 
4. This also reminded me how messed up Grim Fairy tales are.
