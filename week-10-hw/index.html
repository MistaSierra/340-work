              <b>Why is RWD important?</b> </h3>]
              <p> RWD is extremely important if you have any interest in delivering your message effectively. If they viewer
                cannot clearly follow or understand your website is useless. But with effective designs you ensure that whatever you
                are trying to say or inform, will be understood and likely be remembered by the viewer. <br> <br>
                It also increases the likelihood that you and your information will be taken seriously and considered.
                If you website is crap, people will not bother to look or read it and that defeats the purpose of a website.
