1. I worked in Command Prompt while following the listed videos. Where I learned how to navigate and issue commands. I'm still not confident, but I learned a little. Through it is created a new repository and learned how to navigate through my folders.
2. I followed Micheal Music on his videos step by step, which I found to be very helpful. I installed Github and Atom were I created a readme and a text file.
