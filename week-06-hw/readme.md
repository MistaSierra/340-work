1. This assignment was pretty fun, though there was quite a few things to do. One thing I've been thinking about, is how dow we access the data we "harvest" from the websites we make. I also enjoyed looking up the photos.

3. I had to go back and review a lot of things. I wouldn't say that i'm really familiar with HTML stuff. Like I can't recall a whole lot of stuff off of my head, but what we're learning mostly makes sense to me. Will I remember it in the future? Now that is the question (the answer is "probably not" because I have a terrible memory)
4. I also found "issues" helpful when my video wouldn't upload because it was too big.
