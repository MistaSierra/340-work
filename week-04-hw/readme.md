1. The first website I looked at was google in the year 1999 and the year 2008. It was a a real throwback and painful reminder of late 90's early 2000's graphic design. It makes me wonder how anyone could have thought that looked good. And also makes me think about how things will look like in the future and how graphic design will develope  and expand.
2. The next website I looked at was Pixar in also 1999 and 2008, and oh boy. What I found interesting was that, unlike google, Pixar's logo hasn't really changed at all. I for one am thankful that the google logo has changed.
