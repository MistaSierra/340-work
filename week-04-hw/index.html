          <li> Preheat the oven to <del>1,000,000,000</del> <ins>325 degrees F</ins> <i>(165 degrees C)</i>. Grease cookie sheets.</li>
          <li> Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt and set aside.</li>
          <li> In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.</li>
          <li> Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted.</li>
          <li> When you burn them, throw them in the trash and buy them at the store</li>
          <li> eat your lazy cookies and accept your fate. As a meme once said <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain%27t_Nobody_Got_Time_for_That"> ain't nobody got time for that </blockquote></li>
