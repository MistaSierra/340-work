1. I think I generally got assignment. It's pretty easy in itself, but it will only become easy for me through lots of repetition and practice.
2. A problem I had specifically was the placement of the <form>....</form> and <fieldset>...</fieldset> in relation to each of the forms. As well as the placement of the submit button. I was unsure if you placed it in each form or fieldset.
3. Overall I don't think I did too terribly.

5. Also I never have enough information to properly fill this to your standards, so I'm strugglin a bit here.
